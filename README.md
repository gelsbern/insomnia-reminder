# Insomnia Reminder

**Insomnia Reminder** is a lightweight, client-side Fabric mod that gently reminds players to sleep before Minecraft’s insomnia mechanic spawns phantoms.

Instead of punishment or spam, the mod provides configurable on-screen reminders and optional sound cues when insomnia becomes a risk. After a successful night’s sleep, it can also greet the player with a friendly good-morning message.

Designed to be simple, unobtrusive, and easy to configure.
